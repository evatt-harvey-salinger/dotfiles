echo ""
echo "üí° Nerd Fonts Installation:"
echo "   - For proper display in Neovim and terminal emulators (like WezTerm, Alacritty, Kitty),"
echo "     you need to install a Nerd Font on your *local* system."
echo "   - Download from: https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads"
echo "   - Common choices: MesloLGS Nerd Font (as seen in your wezterm.lua), FiraCode Nerd Font."
echo "   - After installing, configure your terminal emulator to use the new font."

echo ""
echo "üí° Terminal Emulator Setup (WezTerm/Kitty):"
echo "   - Your wezterm.lua suggests you use WezTerm."
echo "   - Ensure you have WezTerm or Kitty installed locally for optimal Neovim image support."
echo "   - WezTerm: https://wezterm.org/install.html"
echo "   - Kitty:   https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/binary/"
echo "   - Your 'wezterm.lua' config file has been set up via 'install.sh' if you ran it."

echo ""
echo "üí° Molten-nvim Notebook Setup:"
echo "   - Your TODO.md mentions 'Finish Notebook setups for molten-vim'."
echo "   - Refer to the official molten-nvim documentation for specific steps:"
echo "     https://github.com/benlubas/molten-nvim/blob/main/docs/Notebook-Setup.md"
echo "   - This typically involves installing language kernels (e.g., Jupyter) and other prerequisites."

echo ""
echo "üí° Image.nvim Specific Dependencies (if not covered by brew installs):"
echo "   - Your 'luarocks_and_magik_installation_for_image_nvim.md' mentions:"
echo "     - 'libmagickwand-dev' (typically `apt install` on Linux, but `imagemagick` via brew on macOS includes it)."
echo "     - 'luajit' (can be `brew install luajit`)"
echo "     - 'luarocks' (can be `brew install luarocks`)"
echo "     - 'luarocks install magick' (this installs a Lua package, not a system package, and usually needs `sudo`)"
echo "   - Ensure these are available if your `brew_installs.sh` doesn't cover them or if you're on Linux."
echo "   - If you're on macOS and your `brew_installs.sh` already includes `luarocks`, you might need to manually run `sudo luarocks install magick`."

echo ""
echo "üí° .bashrc or .zshrc configurations:"
echo "   - Your TODO.md mentions 'Add .bashrc configs'."
echo "   - If you have a `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file in your dotfiles, remember to symlink it"
